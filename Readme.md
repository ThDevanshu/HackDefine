# Peer-to-Peer voting app

A Decentralized voting app where anyone can vote their favourite candidate. Users can also participate as candidate after submitting their request and getting approval from admin.


# Problem elaboration

## Problem
Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security threats such as:
- Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.
- Long Queues during elections.
- Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.
- Difficult for differently-abled voters to reach polling booth.
- Cost of expenditure on elections is high.

## Solution
Using Decentralized approach, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable. 

- We can use user voter id number as login credentials(Not implemented in MVP).
- For those who don't have internet availability, local centers can be constructed.


## Why to use

-  You can vote anytime/anywhere (During Pandemics like COVID-19 where itâ€™s impossible to hold elections physically.
- Secure
- Immutable
- Faster
- Transparent
- As more users vote online more nodes will be added hence more secure.
